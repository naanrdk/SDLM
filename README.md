# Semantic Data Layer Management

This Python code provides functionalities for building and managing a semantic data layer (SDL) within a business environment. The SDL serves as an abstraction layer that facilitates the understanding and usage of data across different applications and systems within an organization.

## Introduction

The semantic data layer (SDL) is crucial for organizing and standardizing business terms and their definitions, as well as mapping them to specific fields in data sources. This helps ensure consistency and clarity in data usage across different parts of the organization.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Define business terms using the `define_term` method of the `SDLA` class.
2. Map these terms to specific fields in data sources using the `map_term_to_data` method of the `SDLA` class.
3. Search for relevant terms based on user queries using the `search_terms` method of the `SDLA` class.
4. Retrieve data source mappings for a specific term using the `get_data_source_mappings` method of the `SDLA` class.

## Classes

### Term

Represents a business term within the semantic layer.

#### Attributes:
- `name`: The name of the business term.
- `definition`: The definition of the business term.
- `data_source_mappings`: A list of mappings to source data.

#### Methods:
- `__init__(self, name, definition, data_source_mappings=[])`: Initializes a `Term` object with the given name, definition, and optional data source mappings.
- `add_data_source_mapping(self, data_source, field_name)`: Maps the term to a specific field in a data source.

### SDLA (Core Functionalities)

Core functionalities for building and managing a semantic data layer.

#### Attributes:
- `terms`: A dictionary of `Term` objects (term name -> `Term`).

#### Methods:
- `__init__(self)`: Initializes an SDLA instance with an empty dictionary of terms.
- `define_term(self, name, definition)`: Defines a new business term in the semantic layer.
- `map_term_to_data(self, term_name, data_source, field_name)`: Maps a business term to a specific field in a data source.
- `search_terms(self, search_query)`: Searches for relevant terms based on a user query.
- `get_data_source_mappings(self, term_name)`: Retrieves data source mappings for a specific term.
